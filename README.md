 ## Description
The main goal of this application is to use the skills we learned in class to create a random password generator. password characters include:
- Uppercase Letters (A-Z)
- lowercase letters (a-z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Special Characters (!?#%^*#)

Password Generator is the third challenge for the Ohio State coding bootcamp.
-	My motivation for this project was to become proficient at coding HTML, CSS, and especially Java Script.  
-	Building this project allowed me to implement coding techniques that I have been studying for the past month. 
-	This page was a perfect example of real-world practices and solved the problem of assignments with starter code. 
-	I learned how to code and deploy a simle webpage with nothing more than HTML, CSS, Java Script. 

- I would like to mention a few challenges I faced during this assignment, and what I'm most proud of. Getting the page to refresh itself if the user
  did not input a number that was outside of the parameters for this assignment. Also, getting the page to refresh and convey a message if the user
  said no (cancel) to all of the questions for making a password.
